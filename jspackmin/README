This directory contains an experiementation with compressing all the javascript 
files for the player into a single one. this aims to improve the latency of
downloading a page.

total uncompress = 200k
total compressed = 45k
total post gzip  = 18k (so 9% of the original not bad)

large compression ratio + a single file (instead of 20) should improve the 
latency significantly

- TODO integrate it. this is currently not integrated.
  - depends on how it is organized at the end
  - but for sure js compression is something to do
