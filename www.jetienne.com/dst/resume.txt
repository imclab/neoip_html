OBJECTIVES

  o Preferred working areas : p2p, video and web2.0
  o Share my ever increasing excitement for computer and network.
  o Improve my skills through creativity, curiosity and team working 
    within a fast paced team.

======================================================================
IMPLEMENTED SOFTWARE and MASTERED TECHNOLOGY

Peer to Peer:
      - in depth study of major p2p protocols: bittorrent, gnutella
      - design+dev of web4web.tv protocols: support static+live video streaming
        - low latency optimization for live streaming
        - seamless integration in webpages to leverage web2.0 trend
      - Kademlia DHT implementation for transparent i18n dns replacement

Security/Cryptography:
      - Found vulnerabilities in widely used routing protocols (OSPF and RIP)
        and opensource projects such as vtun and tinc VPN, or encrypted loop-device.  
      - Secure random number generator based on rfc1750
      - Internet Key Exchange(IKE) daemon for IPSec
      - IPSec encryption(ESP) and authentication(AH)
      - Cryptographic algorithms: DES, MD5, SHA1, RSA, Diffie-Hellman
      - Multi precision Modular arithmetic library using Montgomery number
      - Cryptographic authentication for OSPF.
      - yavipin: a secure tunnel using the state of art in network security

Low level Networking:
      - major routing protocols: OSPFv2 (rfc2328), RIPv1/v2 (rfc2453)
      - a mini-TCP stack (not fully compliant with rfc1122/rfc793)
      - a RTP/RTCP stack for a proprietary ip phone demonstration
      - some multicast stuff like IGMPv1/v2 (rfc1112,rfc2236) and being 
        able to send/receive multicast packets.
      - a SNMPv1/v2 server with rfc1213 MIBs
      - better compliance to router requirements (rfc1812), ip frag/reasm

Miscellaneous (old) coding:
      - Database: Efficient SQL engine bottom layer (index via btree,
        multi-user, shared cache, dedicated file-system)
      - Compiler: Lexical parser (regular expressions/DFA), BASIC 4GL compiler
      - Game    : Othello using AlphaBeta, forward pruning using genetic
        and expert systems (ranked 6th in a worldwide contest)
      - AI      : Multiagent/expert/genetic system (mostly for automatic tuning)
      - Image   : Face extraction and recognition, OCR, FFT, MPEG/JPEG
