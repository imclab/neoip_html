webrunner is a firefox without all the menus.
- this directory contains a basic use of it as an experimentation
- maybe i could use it as a raw desklet

-------------------------------------------------------------
report of this short experiment:
- pro: mfinkle, the guy doing webrunner, is nice and very helpfull
- con: it still have all the window decorations
- con: it have a bothering status bar
  - mfinkle told me it is removable with 'hidechrome=true'
  - i tried a little and failed
- it doesnt seems to provide all the nice interaction i would like to have with 
  the window manager.
  - no window decoration
  - dock the window on bottom right
  - have it visible on all desktop
  - kde window manager provides all that but not programmatically (at least
    to my knowledge)

---------------------------------------------------------------
bug encontered
- if the webpage js call the flash very shortly after its creation, flash program
  is not yet initialized and the call will fails
  - webrunner is on a ff3 gecko, so it behaves differently
  - workaround: before starting the js to flash, probe if the flash object is
    already initialized (aka present in webpage and see if object function are
    of typeof() 'function'), and if not, retry a bit later.
- when creating a 'desktop shortcut' the icons inside the .webapp are not
  properly copied.
  - the .desktop do points to a location in ~/.webrunner but no icon there
  - workaround: copy the icons manually and refresh the desktop :)
