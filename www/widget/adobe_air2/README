- BUG what about the issue between player.urfastr.tv/live and webkit
  - it seems very close to init
  - may be close to flash and when i wait for download
  - point on a uncompressed but concatenated js to findout which line fails
  - see about using the full debug version of player to get even more info
  - see about installing air sdk on mac, DONE
    - it is failling all the time
    - is this the same faillure ?
  - see about installing flash debug
  - what about a callback from flash to js when the asplayer ctor is completed ?
    - this would ensure that the flash is fully loaded
    - find a way to experiment this
  - Check that it is this flash init by just adding a timer of 2sec
    - YES it is that! now how to fix it ?
    - possible solution: do a function which is created at ctor end only and test this one
      - this one is simple and dont change anything
      - TODO to test
    - possible solution: to test a bunch of function instead of only one. all function ?
      - simple and good... like all the function in a array
      - only little modification
    - possible solution: have the ctor to notify once completed
    - possible solution: do a explicit delay
- BUG: when the window is transparent, the flash doesnt appear in it
  - no idea why. in relation to wmode transparent ?
  - google for it... see "desktop keeley"
- BUG what about the missed event while moving the window
  - can i detect when the mouse is no more on the title bar ?
- BUG: css on linux
  - mouse wheel on title bar make it disapears
  - this make mouse wheel to disppears ... cool on linux to remove the title bar
  - a feature ? :)
- BUG: on macos, cant quit apps if autoupdate is enabled
  - reason: unknown
  - workaround: to manually quit the main windows
  - look at the class of this icon
  - test if an explicit quit would help
- TODO work: make a real private beta stuff for this
- TODO shiny: animations to appear/disapear the pipwin
  - even linux may have one by tricking the window size + position
- TODO shiny: integrate the transparent support
  - made a bunch of experiment on jquery in expsite
  - integrate those effect in the widget
